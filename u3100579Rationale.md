My goal for this project was to create a functional but pleasing and easy to navigate weather application for everyday use.
My design process began with considering what average users of a weather application require from the program. My own experiences, mostly revolved around checking the current weather in brief frequent intervals, or checking the weekly forecast for temperature, rain, sunset/sunrise times and UV index. I most frequently use this data to plan daily activities and wardrobes. e.g. If itâ€™s going to rain then I should bring the washing in. Is cold enough to wear a jumper? etc. 
Thus I designed my weather app to cater for such uses, quickly checking the weather and planning for the week ahead. From this I decided to use a basic set of data, easy to read on a quick glance, varied enough to be practical.
I had planned originally to include the current weather data, the daily and hourly forecasts, however for simplicity and time I limited my app to a current snapshot and the daily forecasts over the next week. 
For the design, I focused on a simple layout, primarily using text and colour, as well as circles and rounded shapes in the design to provide a sense of friendliness. I wanted the information to be easily and quickly readable, and chose a modular design of individual boxes rather than the slightly intimidating tables of data. However styling these was more difficult than anticipated and thus I didn't have enough time to make the daily forecasts look exactly as I wanted. Due to a lack of time I was unable to polish the CSS to the standard that I had originally intended, but managed to capture the essence of the design using colours and shapes.

These are some similar weather applications, and ones I used for design inspiration.

To create a novel and enjoyable experience I wanted to add a sense of humour and a human touch to my site by displaying different comments depending on the current temperature and weather summaries, in order to provide a sense of personality, without being too distracting. (Some examples of similar sites and inspiration in the images below.) I also wanted to add an element of visual interest, by having the colour scheme change depending on the current temperature. 
I tried to keep a majority of weather data conventions, displaying the information in a way that is familiar to people and easy to read. e.g. Using the classic red/blue colours to signify warm or cold temperatures. The information is mostly displayed in numbers and text, however I dispensed with the arrows common for displaying wind direction and the rain graphs for simplicity. I would have liked to simplify my design further to using easily identifiable symbols but ran out of time. 
I also took the conventional table design for displaying forecast data and used rounded boxes instead, for a less cluttered design, however I did have issues styling these and aligning the data the way i wanted, perhaps it would have been better of to incorporate tables into my design and style them to be less cluttered, rather than styling a box, to look like a table. 
I have attempted to design an everyday weather application that is easy, engaging and enjoyable to use, engaging users with colour and personality.

I did not include these images in my rationale as they feature swearing.
